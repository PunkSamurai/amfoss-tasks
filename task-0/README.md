Task 0. Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]

The objective of this task was to set up a working dual boot environment for developing in Linux.
I achieved this by installing and setting up  Kubuntu, a flavour of Ubuntu running KDE software.
The default Linux kernel included in installation package did not have support my laptop's wifi adapter.
I resolved this by downloading and signing the latest kernel, 5.14.11
I finished the task by installing the necessary software and some light desktop customization.
