Why must we choose you?

While I'm not sure if these are definite advantages or not, I am comfortable with computers, and have prior experience with Linux. If I'm working on a project I can pull of a few consecutive all nighters, no problem. Also I am aware of my weaknesses (debugging!), and am working on improving those areas. And though I still have a lot to learn, I'm (somewhat) quick at picking things up, atleast the basics. I also do my best to help people who ask me questions, as long as it is within my abilities.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Although the number of assignments are increasing, and we might have our mid terms and sem final exams coming up, I'm hoping to be able to become comfortable with C, and start learning C++. Also, I enjoyed solving the problems in task 3, so I'd like to try entering a few other online competitions.

How would you contribute back to the club? 

Honestly I am probably not going to be able to do much right now, but I am comfortable asking questions, and ready to listen to advice. Eventually I hope to be able to contribute to the FOSS community, as well as be a mentor to the freshers a year or two down the line. I am also looking forward to collaborating on various projects with my peers.

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

The selection of tasks was diverse, and I had to think a lot for most of them. Some sort of hint system would have been great, because i found myself getting stuck on something a lot more frequently than i expected, but the seniors were very helpful. One other thing that would have been interesting was if there were group projects within each planet, but then again it probably wouldnt have been really necessary. Overall, I felt like I learned a lot, and had a bit of fun along the way.
