Task 5. Let me C

The objective was to debug a Hangman program wirtten in C.
First, I cleared all the syntax and spelling errors.
Then I tried to understand the code and iron out all the logical errors.
I also wrote a comment for every edit I did.

The biggest issue I faced was my vscode debugger refused to display anything written in printf statements after line 37 properly.
This was on Windows 10. However, an online compiler/debugger worked fine, and i was able to finish the task.

I also tried the code one more time on Linux, and it turns out that Linux does not recognize the cls command.
I replaced cls with clear, and now everything works fine on Linux as well.

I completed the task after testing various input scenarios.
